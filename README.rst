Python modul for processing of parallel models of genetic algorithm. Modul provides master-slave, finegrained and coarsegrained models.
Try modul by installing using Pip:
apt - get install openssh - server
apt - get install python3 .6
apt - get install python3 - pip
python3 .6 -m pip install parallel_ga_processing

Finegrained and coarsegrained models requires communication between demes, respectively nodes. Modul uses RabbitMQ server. It is preferred to install server on remote machine.

Use examples to run modul.
